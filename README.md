🛍️ Customer Segmentation Using Python
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on customer segmentation using machine learning techniques. The main goal is to group customers into distinct segments based on their behavior and demographics, which can help businesses:

Improve marketing strategies

Provide personalized recommendations

Enhance customer experience

📂 Dataset

The dataset used is Shopping Mall Customer Segmentation Data.csv, which contains customer details such as:

Customer ID

Gender

Age

Annual Income (k$)

Spending Score (1–100)

🔑 Steps in the Project

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handling missing values

Checking data types

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualizing age distribution, income, and spending score

Gender-based analysis

Feature Engineering

Selecting features for clustering

Clustering (K-Means)

Finding optimal clusters using the Elbow Method

Applying K-Means clustering

Labeling customer groups

Visualization

Cluster visualization using Matplotlib & Seaborn

Interpreting customer segments

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

📊 Results

Customers were segmented into 5 distinct groups based on annual income and spending score.

Each segment represents a different purchasing behavior (e.g., high income–low spending, low income–high spending, etc.).
