🛍️ Customer Segmentation Using Python

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on customer segmentation using machine learning techniques. The main goal is to group customers into distinct segments based on their behavior and demographics, which can help businesses:
● Improve marketing strategies

● Provide personalized recommendations

● Enhance customer experience

📂 Dataset:
The dataset used contains customer details such as:

● Customer ID
● Gender
● Age
● Annual Income (k$)
● Spending Score (1–100)

🔑 Steps in the Project
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

   ● Handling missing values
   ● Checking data types

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

   ● Visualizing age distribution, income, and spending score
   ● Gender-based analysis

3. Feature Engineering

   ● Selecting features for clustering

4. Clustering (K-Means)

   ● Finding optimal clusters using the Elbow Method
   ● Applying K-Means clustering
   ● Labeling customer groups

5. Visualization

   ● Cluster visualization using Matplotlib & Seaborn
   ● Interpreting customer segments

🛠️ Technologies Used
 ●  Python
 ●  NumPy
 ●  Pandas
 ●  Matplotlib
 ●  Seaborn
 ●  Scikit-learn   

📊 Results
 ●  Customers were segmented into 5 distinct groups based on annual income and spending score.
 ●  Each segment represents a different purchasing behavior (e.g., high income–low spending, low income–high spending, etc.).

📢 Future Improvements

 ●  Try Hierarchical Clustering and compare results
 ●  Build an interactive dashboard in Power BI or Tableau
 ●  Deploy clustering model using Streamlit
